# SmartApplicationPerformanceMonitoring-Auto-Scaling

Problem: Build a system that monitors application performance metrics and automatically scales resources based on predicted demand.

Skills Demonstrated:

AI/ML: Implement time series forecasting for traffic prediction, performance anomaly detection, scaling algorithms

Critical Thinking: Understand performance bottlenecks, balance resource costs vs user experience, consider scaling lag time

Problem Solving: Handle seasonal traffic patterns, sudden load spikes, multi-tier application scaling

Modular Structure: Separate monitoring, prediction, decision engine, and scaling execution modules

Clear Architecture: Pipeline from performance metrics → demand prediction → scaling decisions → resource adjustments

Deliverable: Auto-scaling system that proactively adjusts resources based on predicted demand patterns.
